autoPlan
========

data entry is for computers

dynamically populates [class planning worksheets](http://www.seasoasa.ucla.edu/undergraduates/worksheets-all-majors/CS_2013_2014.pdf) so that you don't have to. Attention is paid to prerequisites and the quarters during which classes are offered. No data entry is required from the user, as all data can be pulled by the application.

(worst case scenario we'll use a scraper + checkboxes for classes taken)
